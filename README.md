# Objective

The objective of this repo is to reproduce the youtube interface.

# Overview

The idea here is to use the newest concepts and stack learning in the last weeks to reproduce in a real word scenario.

The app should be composed of a sidebar and the routing for each page.

# Stacks & New Concepts

- [x]: We shuold be using the `atomic-design-pattern` since we need to customize and clone the app again;

- []: We should be using the `Single SPA` as the `microfrontends` type of architecture;

- [x]: We should be using `context-api` as state management;

- [x]: We should be using the `styled-components` to style the app;

- [x]: We should be using the `fontawesome` as icon library;

- [x]: We should be using also the `prop-types` between the components arguments;

- [x]: We should be using the `service` layer to replicate the backend w/ mocking the response as a SSR;

- [x]: We should be using the `transform` and `transition` css properties;

- []: We should have the same animations on the sidebar as we have on the original website;
